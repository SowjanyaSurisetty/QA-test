# 1.	How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.	
I spend almost 4 hours to complete the task. If given more time I could implement Page Object model and can keep more optimistic.

# 2.	What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
The most important thing in testing is when ever a new feature is developed Tester need not test the all the test cases manually again and again.
I can just Automate the new feature for already existing automated test cases which saves lot of time and cost.
Also the most important trend as per 2020 QA Automation testing includes.. 
        - Web Testing (tools used Selenium,Cucumber,Cypress)
        - API Testing (Rest Assured,Postman,SoapUI)
        - Mobile Testing(Appium)
        - Performance Testing(Apache JMeter,Load Runner,WebLoad,LoadUI)
        - Accessibility Testing
        - Build Automation Tools(Maven, Gradle, sBuild)
        - CI/CD DevOps(Jenkins, Docker, GitHub)
            
            Next Generation Testing
                - Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning
                - IoT Testing
                - Block Chain Testing
# 3. How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
I implemented test automation by inspecting elements on the webpage. The most important thing is to identify/Locating elements by using XPATH expressions
Operated and observed the result.
    - Locate
    - Operate and
    - Observe
The strategy of testing is to check the actual result is satisfying the expected result(requirement Specifications)
I automated multiple applications by implementing Data Driven Framework, Hybrid Driven Framework and Behaviour Driven Framework. The main advantage of BDD framework is even a non-technical persons can also understand.
I implemented Data Driven, Hybrid Driven and also BDD Framework by adding all the required dependencies in POM file in the Maven Project and added Page Object Model which we maintain each objects or elements can be maintained page wise. So when ever a new feature is added into the application we can easily identify by its page. Which is easy to maintain in future.
 # Sample Framework Skeleton :
Project Name
|
Features
|
PageObjectModel
|
Step Definitions
|
Utilities
|
Drivers
|
Target
|
Pom.XML 

# 4. How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?

  - All the areas of UK must be displayed by adding Dropdown list. So that the application will be User friendly	 
  - Unable to sign-up. As I Signed up with my email-id all those textfields are working good but it is not letting me to sign in
  - Forgot password is also Failed as it did not acknowledge.
  - Some of the Restaurants have no images
  - Text is Overlapped and not aligned properly.
  - GUI Testing and Alignment Testing  need to be done
  - Performance Testing is the most important as so many people might use this app at same time so applications response time will be good.
  - Some of the restaurants have no proper logos.
  - Cross Browsing  Testing Must be done. I checked in Internet Explorer, Firefox, MicrosoftEdge and Chrome Browsers.
      - Bug which I observed in IE
Expected Result : These should be white in color
Login Process is should be optimised
Also CheckOut Process should be optimised
